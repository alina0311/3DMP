# Watch Escapement Mechanism
As [**Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapement) says: 
>An escapement is a mechanical linkage in mechanical watches and clocks 🕒 that gives impulses to the timekeeping element and *periodically*  releases the **gear train** ⚙️ to move forward, advancing the clock's hands. The impulse action transfers energy to the clock's timekeeping element (usually a pendulum or **balance wheel**) to replace the energy lost to friction during its cycle 🔄 and keep the timekeeper oscillating.

## Components
I divided the project into 3 main components, each of them having their own subcomponents:
1. **Main Spring**
   - Spring Frame Back
   - Spring Barrel
   - Ratchet
   - Main Spring
   - Winding Stem
   - Spring Frame Front
   - Winding Key
   - Bracket
   - Barrel Ratchet
   - Ratchet Spring
2. **Gear Train**
   - Train Frame Back
   - Gear Train
   - Escape Wheel
   - Train Frame Front
   - Bracket x2
3. **Balance**
   - Balance Frame Back
   - Hairspring
   - Balance
   - Impact Pin Housing
   - Pallet Fork
   - Balance Frame Front
   - Bracket
   
## Steps for 3D modeling the mechanism:
- 🟣 Make the holder parts (frames and brackets)
- 🟣 Make the gears
- 🟣 Make the spirals
- 🟣 Make the other subcomponents 
- 🟣 Align subcomponents for each big component
- 🟣 Add the screws, nuts and washers

## Tasks

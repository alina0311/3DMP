# Watch Escapement Mechanism
As **Wikipedia** says: 
>An escapement is a mechanical linkage in mechanical watches and clocks 🕒 that gives impulses to the timekeeping element and *periodically*  releases the **gear train** ⚙️ to move forward, advancing the clock's hands. The impulse action transfers energy to the clock's timekeeping element (usually a pendulum or **balance wheel**) to replace the energy lost to friction during its cycle 🔄 and keep the timekeeper oscillating.

## Tasks

- [] Make the canvases.  
- [] Divide the project into components.  
- [] Start sketching using the canvases.  
- [] Make sure you have Capture History turned on.  
- [] Make the holder parts: brackets and frames. 
Save multiple versions and suggestively name them.
- [] Properly use names for bodies, components, joints, construction
planes.
- [] Render the object applying appearance and scene.
- [] Save the renderings as photos and as a turntable Render.
- [] Add joints, motion links and joints limits.
- [] Create motion studies.

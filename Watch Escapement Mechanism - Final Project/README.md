# Watch Escapement Mechanism
As **Wikipedia** says: 
>An escapement is a mechanical linkage in mechanical watches and clocks 🕒 that gives impulses to the timekeeping element and *periodically*  releases the **gear train** ⚙️ to move forward, advancing the clock's hands. The impulse action transfers energy to the clock's timekeeping element (usually a pendulum or **balance wheel**) to replace the energy lost to friction during its cycle 🔄 and keep the timekeeper oscillating.

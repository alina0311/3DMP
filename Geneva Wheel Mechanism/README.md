I tried to follow these rules:

1.Divide the mechanism into components
2. Use Fusion Rule Number 1
3. Use suggestive names for your bodies, components, sketches, joints,
contact points, construction planes or any element that you include in your
project
4. Create a stand for the mechanism so they will not levitate
5. Add joints and create a motion study
6. Add appearances and render the mechanism
